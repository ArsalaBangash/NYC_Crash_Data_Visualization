# NYC_Crash_Data_Visualization
For my culminating assignment in high school, I had to take crash data from New York City, and create a visual represenatation of the comma seperated data. 

I used the Processing IDE and programmed in Java to create a program that displayed how different types of vehicles varied in their crash frequencies. Along with that, I had two bubbles operating under Perlin noise, which displayed the date of the crashes and the borough of New York city wherein the crashes were occuring. 

NOTE: Since GitHub does not allow files that exceed 25mb in size, I had compressed the collisions csv file into an RAR
